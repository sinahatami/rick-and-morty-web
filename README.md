## 🚀 Features

- **Multiverse Explorer** — Browse detailed lists of Characters, Locations, and Episodes.

- **Deep Linking** — Fully interconnected data. Navigate from a Character to their Origin Location, or see all Characters in a specific Episode.

- **Advanced Filtering** — Filter by status, species, gender, type, and dimension.

- **URL Synchronization** — All search and filter states are synced to the URL (`useUrlSync`), allowing users to share exact search results.

- **Infinite Scrolling** — Seamless pagination powered by TanStack Query.

- **Responsive Design** — Mobile-first layout with a custom navigation drawer and grid system.

## 🏗 Architecture & Design Patterns

This project follows a modular, feature-based architecture to ensure maintainability and scalability.

### 1. Centralized API Layer

All data fetching logic is encapsulated in `src/lib/api-client.ts`. This provides a type-safe, consistent interface for the entire application and handles 404/Error states globally.

### 2. Custom Hooks

Logic is extracted into reusable hooks to keep components clean:

- `useUrlSync` — Manages two-way binding between the UI (Search Bar/Filters) and URL query parameters.
- `useCharacters` / `useLocations` / `useEpisodes` — Specialized hooks wrapping React Query's `useInfiniteQuery` for data fetching and caching.

### 3. Component Design System

A set of atomic, shared components ensures UI consistency:

- `BaseCard` — Handles hover effects, shadows, and theme colors (Green for Characters, Blue for Locations, Orange for Episodes).
- `ResourcePageLayout` — A higher-order layout component that standardizes the header, search bar, grid, and loading states across all list pages.
- `EmptyState` / `NotFoundState` — Standardized UI for error handling.
